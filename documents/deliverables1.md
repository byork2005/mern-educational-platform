## Mission
Creating an educational platform for teachers and students to collaborate in an interactive fashion.  The teacher will have the ability to add applications, track progress and manage their class rosters for each application.
There will be there three preloaded free applications available. Additional applications will be available with licenses that are purchased by the School District or Department. These additional licenses can be customized specifically by the department or teacher.
